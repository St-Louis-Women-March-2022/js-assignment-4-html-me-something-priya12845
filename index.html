            <ls>Travel is the most intersting thing one can do. And I love traveling. It brings about a break in routine life, refreshing oneself. It keeps you energised. It can be a trip to smallest village or the biggest cities. You get to see something
                new and different everytime. We can travel by any mode of transportation. Like Cruise ships, cars, trains, planes and even bikes are awesome rides. I prefer cars the best wherever possible.

        <p id="trip"> I wish to explore as many places as I can. My recent visit was to India. What an amazing trip it was. Meeting friends and family there. Going places. Eating street food. Dressing up fancy :). It was 1.5 months long trip this time. I had stayed
            at Ahmedabad with my parents my daughter almost the whole time of the trip.

            Then, visited Vaishno Devi one of the very big pilgrimage. Around 5000-10000 people visit there every day. It's a uphill climb to the temple, which you can do by walk, helicopter and various other ways. A lovely experience over all in the hills.
